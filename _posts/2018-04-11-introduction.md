title: The Valhalla Platform is Coming!
---
Hello Vikings, welcome to Valhalla - Our Game Development Platform for the future! We are super excited to welcome you to our new blogging site.

The PTR team’s long journey is soon going to bear fruit with the anticipated release of the upcoming Match 3 feature for FishWorld in June. Stay tuned to this space for more exciting details dedicated to that very topic.

Valhalla is still a work in progress, of course, and will continue to be into the future. Our goals are twofold:

Short Term - We are providing technical capability and support for migrating Worlds’ games from Flash to HTML5. Our tools will enable the Worlds teams to add features such as Match 3 into the live environment. PTR will support the Worlds teams and help them to incrementally gain understanding of our new capabilities.

Long term, we will design and build THE BEST development platform for HTML5 games. Once our own game teams are working smoothly with the new tech, we are going to take Valhalla to the world. We are setting our sights high and want to go head to head with the best tools available in the marketplace. It’s quite a challenge, but that’s what makes it fun!

Starting immediately, new posts will be added to this site weekly. We will keep everyone up to date on progress, post examples and snippets, and more!

Thanks for reading!
