title: The Valhalla Platform is Coming!

Welcome to Valhalla! - WIP

Hello Vikings, we are excited to welcome you to our blogging site!

What has been a long journey for the PTR team is soon going to bear fruit, with the anticipated release of the upcoming Match 3 feature in June. We will have more exciting details on that very soon in a post dedicated to the topic.

Valhalla is still a work in progress of course, and will continue to be into the future. Our goals are twofold:

Short Term - The goal is to support our Worlds migrations from Flash to Html5. The tools will also enable the Worlds teams to add features such as Match 3 into the production environment, incrementally gaining understanding of our new technology.

The long term goal is to design and build the BEST development platform for HTML5 games. Once our own game teams are working smoothly with the new tech, we are going to take it to the world. We are setting our sights high and want to go head to head with the best tools available in the marketplace. Quite a challenge, but that's what makes it fun! 
   
Starting immediately, this blog will be updated weekly. We will keep everyone up to date on progress, post examples, snippets, etc. 
   
Enjoy!
