The Valhalla Platform is Coming! - WIP

Hello Vikings, we are happy to welcome you to our blogging site!

What has been a long journey for the PTR team is soon going to bear fruit, with the release of the upcoming Match 3 feature in June. We will have more exciting details on that next week in a post dedicated to that topic.

BVGâ€™s Valhalla Platform is still a work in progress of course, and will continue to be into the future. Our goals are twofold:

Short Term - The goal here is to support our Worlds migration from Flash to Html5, and to enable Worlds to add features such as Match 3 into the production environment, while gaining knowledge of our new technology.

<would be nice to insert the short term roadmap here or something>

The long term goal is to design and build the BEST development platform for HTML5 games. We are setting our sights high and want to go head to head with the best tools available in the marketplace. Quite a challenge, but that's what makes it fun!


Starting immediately, this blog will be updated weekly. We will keep everyone up to date on progress, post examples, snippets, etc.

Enjoy!
